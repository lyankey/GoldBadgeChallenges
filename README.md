<h1>Gold Badge Challenges / Business Challenges</h1>

**Description**
These are Dotnet console aps written using C# and a repository pattern. They will run several console apps that let an imaginary business use varieties of Create/Update/Read/Delete to store and retrieve information about their imaginary data. These projects were done as part of the 12-week full-time Software Development Bootcamp, Gold Badge Challenge.  

**Table of Contents**
This includes console apps for challenges 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are each variations of a CRUD console.  
1 Restaurant Menu | 2 Insurance Console | 3 Security Badges                      | 4 Outings Expenditures
CRUD              | CRUD with a list    |CRUD with dictionary and keyvalue pairs | CRUD with parsing strings to ints, doubles, dates


**Installation:**
These can be opened using Visual Studio Community

**Usage:**
I don't know why anyone would use these, as they are just student projects that are not complete or ready for actual use.
